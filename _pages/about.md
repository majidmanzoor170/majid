## 👋 Hi, I'm Majid Manzoor

I am a Master's student in **Computer Science and Technology** at **Southwest Jiaotong University (SWJTU)** in Chengdu, China.  
My work focuses on **computer vision**, **deep learning**, and **autonomous systems**.

I am interested in building efficient vision models for real-world applications, such as autonomous driving, UAV-based perception, and intelligent sensing systems. I enjoy designing and implementing deep learning pipelines, optimizing models for deployment, and experimenting with modern architectures such as Vision Transformers and advanced detection networks.
