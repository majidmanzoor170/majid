Our preprint **“Spatial–Spectral Transformer with Gated Local and Spectral Self-Attention for Hyperspectral Forensic Imaging”** is now available online.

This work introduces **GLoSSFormer**, a compact spatial–spectral transformer designed for accurate, non-destructive forensic stain identification using hyperspectral imaging. The model leverages **gated local and spectral self-attention** to effectively fuse global spatial context with fine spectral features.

The framework achieves **98.53% accuracy** on the HyperBlood dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in distinguishing blood from visually similar substances such as artificial blood, tomato concentrate, beetroot juice, and various paints.

A full-text version is available on **SSRN (5334108)**.
