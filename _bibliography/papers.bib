  abstract    = {In recent years approximately \$30 billion has been invested in the development of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). The increasing adoption of AVs demands precise Lane and Obstacle Detection (LOD) to ensure safe and reliable transportation. This paper aims to propose a monocular camera-based LOD method for Autonomous Driving (AD). We employ YOLO for real-time object detection while Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) extract lane boundaries for accurate road mapping. Our approach utilizes Intersection over Union (IoU) for effective object tracking, allowing us to associate detected vehicles across frames and enhance Lane Detection (LD) accuracy. Dash camera data provides a top view of the scene, while an adaptive thresholding technique with sliding windows ensures reliable detection. YOLO11s improves real-time detection and achieves a mAP50 of 0.818 over YOLOv5s (0.691) and YOLOv8s (0.687), demonstrating the effectiveness of ObstaLaneYOLO.},

  abstract = {Hyperspectral imaging has garnered significant attention across diverse fields, including remote sensing, medical diagnostics, earth observation, mineral exploration, food quality assessment, and forensic science. Despite its potential, its applications in forensic investigations remain underexplored, with most existing analyses conducted in laboratory settings or performed manually. Bloodstain identification is a crucial component of forensic reconstruction, as it provides essential evidence in crime scenes and accidents. However, accurately differentiating blood from visually similar substances such as artificial blood, tomato concentrate, ketchup, beetroot juice, poster paint, and acrylic paint remains a persistent challenge. Moreover, conventional chemical-based detection methods often compromise subsequent DNA integrity, limiting downstream genetic analysis. To overcome these limitations, we propose a non-destructive stain classification framework based on hyperspectral imaging, which preserves sample integrity and minimizes the influence of visual confounders. We introduce GLoSSFormer, a compact spatial-spectral transformer architecture that leverages a gated attention mechanism to adaptively fuse global spatial context with grouped spectral representations. The model incorporates a lightweight four-layer encoder and positional encoding to preserve spatial coherence while enhancing spectral discrimination. Extensive experiments on the publicly available HyperBlood dataset demonstrate that GLoSSFormer achieves an overall accuracy of 98.53\%, surpassing state-of-the-art models in accurately identifying blood against challenging distractor substances. These findings highlight the efficacy and reliability of GLoSSFormer as a robust tool for non-invasive hyperspectral forensic stain analysis, with promising implications for automated crime scene reconstruction and forensic diagnostics.}

  abstract    = {Natural disasters can cause catastrophic damage and often strike unexpectedly, leaving communities vulnerable and disrupting critical infrastructure. Response authorities must quickly classify the disaster to mitigate its effects, which can be challenging because of transportation and communication breakdowns in affected areas. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can be used for real-time surveillance in remote regions, capturing critical visuals that enable Computer Vision (CV) techniques to analyze and classify the disaster type, supporting timely response efforts. For the classification task, we propose DisasterViT, a lightweight Vision Transformer (ViT) with an External Attention (EA) mechanism optimized for high performance. DisasterViT is trained on a custom dataset of 3,720 images from four distinct disaster categories: cyclone, earthquake, flood, and wildfire, and achieves an overall accuracy of 91\% in classifying diverse disaster scenarios.}
